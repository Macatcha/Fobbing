# Fobbing/ Calcium
Quasi-useful py script to automate calcium level rebalancing in swimming pools.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional pool guy or make a business from pools, pool equipment, or the like! I am a retired math educator who continually learns about interpretive programming languages (Python), info sec, and Linux. This idea of a calcium calculator, of sorts, came from a need of my dad to reduce his pool calcium concentration, as do all pool owners eventually! Hope it is useful for you, too.

[Many thanks to George Pipis' "How To Write Interactive Python Scripts" by George Pipis <<https://predictivehacks.com>>, whose script provided a nice template for poolCALCIUM.py. This was noted in first commit, as well, but somehow got lost in editing.]

The poolCALCIUM.py calculates the volume exchange needed to re-equilibrate one's swimming pool calcium concentration. High concentrations of calcium in a swimming pool will blotch the surface, cause scaly-white precipitous buildup, staining, corrosive activity to metal fittings, etc. Not good:(.

Once you've got the volume you need to drain out and refill with tap (source) water, determine the pumped flow rate of water from your pool using a 5-gal bucket and timer to gauge how long it will take to pump out the needed volume. Refill. Run your pump. Wait a day or two and re-check calcium concentration.

Keep in mind this python script needs to run in command line. Originally, this was set up in Google sheets (Excel) and likely that would suit more people so it may be added in here, too. Go to branches above and see if a link has been added for a spreadsheet version of this .py program.

Thanks for checking this out!
